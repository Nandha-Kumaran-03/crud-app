# crud-app
A CRUD app with a Vite, React, and Bootstrap frontend and an Express.js backend managed with Nodemon. It connects to MongoDB for data storage, but the POST request to add data isn't updating the database. The frontend is fully functional, showcasing seamless design and modularity. Organized into client (frontend) and server (backend) folders.
